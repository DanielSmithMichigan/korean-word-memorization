Your responsibility is just to edit code.

Do not run the linter.
Do not run the build command.
Do not run the deploy command.
Do not cd to other directories.
Do not install packages.
Do not run the tests.

If we need to install packages, it's ok to edit the package json and expect me to notice and run npm install.

I already know when to do the other things.
