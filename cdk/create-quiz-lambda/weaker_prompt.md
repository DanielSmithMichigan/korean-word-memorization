**Instructions:**
1.  Use the `Original Korean Phrase` for the `korean_sentence` field.
2.  Parse the `[English Translation]` section for the `english_sentence` field.
3.  Parse the `[Word-by-Word Translation]` section for the `word_by_word_translation` array.
4.  Use the text from `[Concise Translation Explanation]` for the `conciseTranslationExplanation` field.
5.  Parse the `[Korean Choices]` section to build the `korean_choices` array.
6.  Parse the `[English Choices]` section to build the `english_choices` array.
